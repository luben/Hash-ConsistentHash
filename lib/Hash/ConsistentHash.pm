=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Hash::ConsistentHash;
    use String::CRC32;

    my $chash = Hash::ConsistentHash->new(
        buckets   => [qw(10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.3 10.0.0.4)],
        hash_func => \&crc32
    );
    # get just one bucket
    my $server = $chash->get_bucket('foo');

    # or get a serie of non-repeating buckets through iterator
    my $next  = $chash->lookup('bar');
    $server   = $next->(); # get bucket
    # do stuff with $server
    $server   = $next->(); # get another bucket
    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hash::ConsistentHash algorithm distributes keys over fixed number of buckets.
Constant hash distribution means that if we add a bucket to a hash with N
buckets filled with M keys we have to reassign only M/(N+1) keys to new
buckets.

What puts apart this module from all similar modules available is that you
could ask for non-repeatable series of buckets. Using this property you
could implement not only consistent distribution but also redundancy - one
key to be directed to more than one bucket.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates ConsistentHash object. It accept following params:

=over

=item hash_func

Hash function to be used on keys and buckets

=item buckets

Arrayref or Hashref. If buckets are given as arrayref they will have
same weight. If given as hashref, every bucket could have differend
weight.

Examples:

    # All buckets have same weight so they will hold equal amount of keys
    my $chash = Hash::ConsistentHash->new(
        buckets => [qw(A B C)],
        hash_func=>\&crc32 );

    # Bucket "B" will hold twice the amount of keys of bucket A or C
    my $chash = Cash::ConsistentHash->new(
        buckets => {A=>1, B=>2, C=>1},
        hash_func=>\&crc32 );

=head2 lookup

Lookup a key in the hash. Accept one param - the key. Returns an iterator
over the hash buckets.

Example:

    my $chash = Hash::ConsistentHash->new(
        buckets => [qw(A B C)],
        hash_func=>\&crc32 );

    my $next   = $chash->lookup('foo');
    my $bucket = $next->(); # B
    $bucket    = $next->(); # A
    $bucket    = $next->(); # C, hash is exhausted
    $bucket    = $next->(); # A
    ...

Returned buckets will not repeat until all buckets are exhausted.

sub lookup {
    my ($self,$key) = @_;
    my $idx = $self->{hash_func}->($key) & $self->{mask};
    my $ring= $self->{ring};
    my %seen;
    my $returned = 0;
    return sub {
        # start from the beggining if we have already returned all buckets
        if ($returned >= $self->{buckets}){
            $returned = 0;
            %seen = ();
        }
        while($seen{$ring->[$idx]}){
            $idx++;
            $idx = 0 if $idx > $self->{mask};
        }
        $seen{$ring->[$idx]}=1;
        $returned ++;
        return $ring->[$idx];
    }
}

=head2 get_bucket

Lookup a key in the hash. Accept one param - the key. Returns a bucket.

Example:

    my $chash = Hash::ConsistentHash->new(
        buckets => [qw(A B C)],
        hash_func=>\&crc32 );

    my $bucket  = $chash->get_bucket('foo');

sub get_bucket {
    my ($self,$key) = @_;
    my $idx = $self->{hash_func}->($key) & $self->{mask};
    return $self->{ring}->[$idx];
